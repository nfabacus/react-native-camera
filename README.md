# Basic Camera App using React Native

This app takes photos from your cameras and save them into another page (image library), separate from the normal camera roll.

### Next Steps
- Functionality to select and delete individual photos from the image library.
- Better siziing of the photos in the image library (styling)
- Cropping and zooming of the images if necessary.
