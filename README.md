# Basic Camera App using React Native

This app takes photos from your cameras and display them into an image library page. <br/>
The photos are saved into a folder for this app in your device's file system assigned by Expo, separate from the normal camera roll.

You can also delete photos from the image library.

I referenced this repo https://github.com/expo/camerja , and made this version, with delete functionality.
